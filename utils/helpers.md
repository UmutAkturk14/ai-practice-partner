# Utility Helpers (Stubs Only)
- Validation ideas:
  - Check BPM range; ensure positive integer.
  - Verify chord tokens are in allowed vocabulary.
  - Mood tag normalization.

- Time utilities:
  - Convert BPM to milliseconds per beat (formula placeholder).
  - Map grid indices to timestamps for export planning.

- RNG utilities:
  - Deterministic seeding for reproducible Markov sampling.

- TODO:
  - Define shared data shapes for chords/drums/bass layers.
  - Add logging strategy (no implementation).
