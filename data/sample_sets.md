# Sample Datasets (Stub Notes)
- Placeholder description of what future datasets contain:
  - Example chord progressions per mood (text only).
  - Drum pattern archetypes expressed as grid indices.
  - Bass motifs tagged by feel (walk, sustain, ostinato).

- Pseudocode for loading (non-functional):
```
function load_samples(mood):
    TODO: select sample set by mood
    return { chord_templates: [], drum_templates: [], bass_templates: [] }
```

- TODO:
  - Decide file format (JSON/YAML) for symbolic data.
  - Add versioning metadata for reproducibility.
