# AI Practice Partner
- Intent: scaffold for a music-practice backing track generator (no real code yet).
- Capabilities: interpret BPM/chord sequence/mood, generate chord/drum/bass layers, plan for MIDI/WAV export.
- Boundaries: only comments, pseudocode, architecture notes, and TODO markers. No imports or executable logic.
- Structure: see `agent/`, `music/`, `data/`, `export/`, `utils/`, `docs/`, `api/`.
- Next: fill stubs with real implementations, data models, and test coverage once algorithms are approved.
